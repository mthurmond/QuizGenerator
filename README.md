# quiz-generator
Generates a quiz, accepts user input, and grades it for accuracy. 

Uses an array with nested objects to store all question information. Uses loops and conditional statements to prompt the user for input and to cycle through and grade each response.   

To update the questions, just update the "question" and "answer" properties of each object.
